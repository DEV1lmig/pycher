### Analysis Summary

# Backend Architecture Overview

The backend of the Pycher application is structured as a microservices architecture, with several independent services communicating to provide the overall functionality. This design promotes modularity, scalability, and independent deployment of different functional areas.

## Core Services

The backend is composed of the following key services, each responsible for a specific domain:

### **API Gateway**
The [API Gateway](file:backend/api-gateway/main.py) acts as the single entry point for all client requests. It is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate backend services, handling authentication, and potentially performing other cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting and logging.

### **AI Service**
The [AI Service](file:backend/ai-service/main.py) is dedicated to handling artificial intelligence-related functionalities. This likely includes features such as intelligent code suggestions, automated feedback on exercises, or chatbot interactions.

### **Content Service**
The [Content Service](file:backend/content-service/main.py) manages all educational content within the platform. This includes courses, modules, lessons, and exercises. It provides APIs for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting content.
- **Database Interactions**: The service interacts with the database via [database.py](file:backend/content-service/database.py) and defines its data models in [models.py](file:backend/content-service/models.py).
- **API Endpoints**: The [routes.py](file:backend/content-service/routes.py) file defines the API endpoints for content management.
- **Business Logic**: Core content-related business logic is encapsulated in [services.py](file:backend/content-service/services.py).
- **Data Schemas**: Data validation and serialization are handled by schemas defined in [schemas.py](file:backend/content-service/schemas.py).

### **Execution Service**
The [Execution Service](file:backend/execution-service/main.py) is responsible for executing user-submitted code. This service likely runs code in a secure, isolated environment and returns the results to the user. It includes:
- **Code Validation**: The [validators.py](file:backend/execution-service/validators.py) file likely contains logic for validating user-submitted code before execution.
- **Testing**: The [tests](file:backend/execution-service/tests) directory contains tests for the execution functionality, specifically [test_exercises.py](file:backend/execution-service/tests/test_exercises.py).

### **User Service**
The [User Service](file:backend/user-service/main.py) manages all user-related functionalities, including user registration, authentication, profile management, and progress tracking.
- **Authentication**: The [auth.py](file:backend/user-service/auth.py) file handles authentication logic.
- **Database Interactions**: Similar to the Content Service, it uses [database.py](file:backend/user-service/database.py) for database connectivity and defines user-related data models in [models.py](file:backend/user-service/models.py).
- **API Endpoints**: User-related API endpoints are defined in [routes.py](file:backend/user-service/routes.py).
- **Business Logic**: User-specific business logic resides in [services.py](file:backend/user-service/services.py).
- **Data Schemas**: [schemas.py](file:backend/user-service/schemas.py) defines the data structures for user-related data.
- **Utilities**: The [utils.py](file:backend/user-service/utils.py) file contains utility functions.
- **Templates**: The [templates](file:backend/user-service/templates) directory contains HTML templates, such as [progress_report.html](file:backend/user-service/templates/progress_report.html).

## Shared Components

The [shared](file:backend/shared) directory contains common resources and configurations used across multiple backend services.

### **Alembic Migrations**
The [alembic](file:backend/shared/alembic) directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic. These scripts are crucial for evolving the database schema over time without losing data. The `versions` subdirectory contains individual migration files, each representing a change to the database schema.

### **Shared Models**
The [models](file:backend/shared/models) directory within `shared` contains common database models that might be used by multiple services, such as [content.py](file:backend/shared/models/content.py) and [user.py](file:backend/shared/models/user.py). This promotes data consistency and reduces redundancy across services.

### **Seed Data**
The [seed_data](file:backend/shared/seed_data) directory contains JSON files used to populate the database with initial data, such as [seed_courses.json](file:backend/shared/seed_courses.json), [seed_exercises.json](file:backend/shared/seed_exercises.json), [seed_lessons.json](file:backend/shared/seed_lessons.json), [seed_modules.json](file:backend/shared/seed_modules.json), and [seed_users.json](file:backend/shared/seed_users.json). The [seed_db.py](file:backend/shared/seed_db.py) script is likely used to load this data into the database.

## Overall Functionality

The microservices work in concert to provide the full functionality of the Pycher application:

1.  **User Interaction**: Users interact with the frontend, which communicates with the **API Gateway**.
2.  **Authentication and Authorization**: The **API Gateway** routes authentication requests to the **User Service**.
3.  **Content Delivery**: Requests for courses, lessons, and exercises are routed to the **Content Service**.
4.  **Code Execution**: When a user submits code for an exercise, the request is routed to the **Execution Service** for processing.
5.  **AI-Powered Features**: AI-related functionalities are handled by the **AI Service**.
6.  **Data Management**: All services interact with their respective databases, with shared models and migration handled through the `shared` directory.

This modular design allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each functional area, contributing to a robust and maintainable backend system.

### Implementation Steps
