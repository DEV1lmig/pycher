# User Data Structure Analysis

## Current User Data Structure

Based on the analysis of `seed_users.json`, each user follows this structure:

```json
{
  "user_info": {
    "id": number,
    "username": string,
    "email": string,
    "password": string,
    "first_name": string,
    "last_name": string
  },
  "enrollments": [
    {
      "user_id": number,
      "course_id": number,
      "is_completed": boolean,
      "progress_percentage": float,
      "is_active": boolean,
      "exam_unlocked": boolean
    }
  ],
  "module_progress": [
    {
      "user_id": number,
      "module_id": number,
      "is_completed": boolean,
      "is_unlocked": boolean
    }
  ],
  "lesson_progress": [
    {
      "user_id": number,
      "lesson_id": number,
      "is_completed": boolean
    }

## Current User Patterns

### User 101 (Beginner)
- Course 1, 25% progress
- Module 1 completed, Module 2 unlocked, Module 3 locked
- Lessons 1-3 completed
- Exercises 1-3 completed
- Exam not unlocked

### User 102 (Intermediate)
- Course 1, 50% progress
- Modules 1-2 completed, Module 3 unlocked
- Lessons 1-7 completed
- Exercises 1-7 completed
- Exam not unlocked

### User 103 (Advanced)
- Course 1, 90% progress
- All modules (1-3) completed
- All lessons (1-11) completed
- All exercises (1-11) completed
- Exam unlocked but no exam submissions

### User 104 (Pro)
- Multiple courses enrolled
- Course 1: 100% complete with exam submission (exercise 12)
- Course 2: 100% complete
- Course 3: 95% complete with exam unlocked
- All lessons and exercises completed for enrolled courses

## Key Patterns Identified

### Progress Calculation
- Progress percentage appears to be based on lesson completion
- ~92% progress when all lessons completed but exam not taken
- 100% when exam is also completed

### Module Unlocking Pattern
- Modules unlock sequentially
- All modules must be completed for exam to unlock
- `is_unlocked: true` and `is_completed: true` for completed modules

### Exercise Submission Pattern
- Each exercise has realistic Python code
- All submissions marked as `is_correct: true`
- `attempt_number: 1` for all current submissions
- Exercise submissions include both `exercise_id` and `lesson_id`

### Exam Unlocking Pattern
- `exam_unlocked: true` when all course lessons completed
- No exam submissions initially for exam-ready users
- Exam exercises don't have `lesson_id` (they're course-level)
